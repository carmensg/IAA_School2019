Fourier Methods
---------------

In the first part of Day 4, we are going through a few Fourier methods 
to look for periodicities in counting data from an X-ray telescope and 
generic light curves from optical telescopes.

This tutorial requires the following Python software:

1. Dependencies: 
```
pip install numpy scipy astropy numba statsmodels pyregion matplotlib pandas ipython
```

2. Main software packages used in the tutorial:
```
pip install git+https://stingraysoftware/stingray.git git+https://stingraysoftware/hendrics.git git+https://nanograv/pint.git
```
